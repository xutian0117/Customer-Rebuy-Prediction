# Customer Rebuy Prediction Model

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model designed to predict whether a one-time customer will make a repeat purchase. The model leverages various features such as customer demographics, purchase history, product details, and more. By using advanced feature engineering and machine learning algorithms, the model provides actionable insights to enhance customer retention strategies.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system. You can check your Python version using:

```bash
python --version
```

## Step-by-Step Guide
### 1. Clone the repository:
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-rebuy-prediction.git
cd customer-rebuy-prediction
```
### 2. Install the required packages:
Install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
### Feature Engineering
Run the feature engineering script to process the dataset and create the necessary features:

```bash
python src/feature_engineering.py
```

### Model Training
Train the model using the processed dataset:

```bash
python src/train_model.py
```
### Making Predictions
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data:

```bash
python src/predict.py
```
### Tests
To ensure the feature engineering script works correctly, run the unit tests:

```bash
pytest tests/test_feature_engineering.py
```
